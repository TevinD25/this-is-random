# this-is-random

#user story:

As User I want to find things to do in my area so that I don't have to decide and it will be chosen randomly for me.

MVP:
The target audience would be people 21+ that are more spontaneous.
We are hoping to address the problem of indecisivenes.
We believe that the app can make the decision of what to do by iving random events beased on location and weather.
