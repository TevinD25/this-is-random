# this-is-random

#user story:

As User I want to find things to do in my area so that I don't have to decide and it will be chosen randomly for me.

Given the user visits the site, they are asked for input for an indoor or outdoor activity.
When the user asks for an activity location, they will be asked to select further criteria for the random event generator
When the user asks for selected criteria, they are given a limited number of random events to locations for an activity.
